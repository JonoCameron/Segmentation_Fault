Introduction:

Thank you for downloading What's in the Cupboard, a useful application for
making meals out of the remaining ingredients found in the cupboard, fridge or 
pantry. Any foodstuff at hand can be entered into the app to make food.

Installation:

THIS NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. I ASSUME THIS IS SOLELY A MOBILE APP WHICH CAN BE 
DEMONSTRATED ON A COMPUTER, THEREFORE COMPUTER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD
NOT BE NECCESSARY BUT CAN BE ADDED.

SHOULD PROBABLY GO AFTER THE DOCUMENTATION OF TOOLS.

Documentation:
	-Overview:
		The product should Enter the ingredients from your cupboard and
		the quantity available to the user. It will use the Spoonacular
		API to give back recipes that utilise the most of those 
		ingredients. This will focus on the student demographic or anyone
		who finds themselves with spare ingredients. 
		
/*	-Directions for Use:
		-Enter the ingredients you have in the search bar.
		-Home screen has a search bar to enter ingredients that are 
		available to the user in a string with items separated by a comma.
		-Press the search button.
		-After pressing search, view the meals you can make and pick your 
		 fancy!

		 displaying: the title, a picture of the meal, the full recipe 
		 and the popularity of the dish.

	-Tools:
		Eclipse IDE 2018-19
		-What's in the Cupboard was written in Java.
		-For development, recommended use of the Eclipse IDE 2018-19,
		 although any environment to write Java is satisfactory, 
		 Eclipse allows developers to easily include external, non-
		 standard open-source libraries.
		 
		-Download for Eclipse can be found here:
		 https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

		Android Studio
		-Android Studio is a full IDE allowing to write an Android 
		 application fully and has the capabilities to emulate a number 
		 of versions of Android OS and various phone models
	
		-Download for Android Studio can be found here:
		 https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/
	
	-Language and Libraries:
		Spoonacular
		-Spoonacular is the API used for processing ingredients. It has 
		 many different functions to return images, recipes, nutrition
		 facts and even wine pairings for a meal, to name a few.
		-Whilst technically free, Spoonacular does charge depending on 
		 how many calls are made to the API a day. Students can access
		 the API for $10/month for 5000 calls/day.

		-Full listing of the Spoonacular API can be found here:
		 https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition

		Unirest for Java: "Lightweight HTTP Request Client Libraries
		-A particularly useful library for accessing the Spoonacular API.
		-When included in with Eclipse it becomes a powerful tool for 
		 developing the back-end of the application.
